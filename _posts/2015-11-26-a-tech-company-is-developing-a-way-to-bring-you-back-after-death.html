<p>Humai are a tech company who are adamant that they can develop a way to bring us back from the dead. What&#8217;s even more amazing is they say they can do it in the next thirty years. They plan to create&#160;an artificial body that our consciences can then be transferred to at the moment of our death.</p>

<p>Although this sounds like a science fiction blockbuster its a lot closer to reality than you might think. Our brains are packed full of data and as technology develops our ability to store and process it will increase.&#160;<a title="http://humaitech.com/" href="http://humaitech.com/" rel="nofollow">Humai</a>&#160;are working on human resurrection through artificial intelligence and believe they could could produce their initial &#8216;I-Human&#8217; in just three decades.</p>
<p>They plan to use nanotechnology to recreate&#160;conversational styles, behavioral patterns and thought processes.</p>

</p><p>Humai are based in L.A and were founded by Josh Bocanegra who states on the website that.&#160;&#8220;Humai is an AI company with a mission to reinvent the afterlife. We want to bring you back to life after you die.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wish Josh and all at Humai the best in their endeavors. &#160;In the meantime I suggest you watch Charlie Brooker&#8217;s hit TV drama <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/">&#8216;Black Mirror&#8217;</a> &#8211; this fantastic series explores what life could be like in the future with one episode focussing in on this exact type of technology. It&#8217;s well worth a watch, you can catch it on Netflix.</p>
