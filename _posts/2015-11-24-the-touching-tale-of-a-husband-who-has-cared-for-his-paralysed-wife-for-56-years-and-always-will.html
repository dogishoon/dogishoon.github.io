<p>Let&#8217;s face it, a lot of shit has been happening in the world recently. But this article is here to assure you that there are still some good people lingering around the streets. Particularly around the streets of China.</p>
<p>In the village of Sunjiayo, in China&#8217;s Shandog Province, you can find a man called Du Yuanfa. He lives with his wife, Zhou, whom he cares for an awful lot, both figuratively and literally.</p>
<p>&#160;<a href="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1203.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108940" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1203.jpg" alt="1"  ></a></p>
<p>In 1959, five months after they had been pronounced husband and wife, tragedy struck. At the ripe age of 20 Zhou became infected with an unknown illness that left her paralysed, unable to walk for life. Despite numerous hospital visits the newlyweds were told that Zhou would be bed-ridden forever.</p>
<p>Yuanfa left his job as a coal miner to be at his wife&#8217;s side after doctors reached their saddening conclusion. But the pair were not alone, help began to pour in from family and friends who were eager to help the couple&#160;out financially.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2133.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-108939" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2133.jpg" alt="2"  ></a></p>

<p>However, Yuanfa turned down their offers and said to his wife, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I will care for you forever.&#8221; And quite clearly this chap is a man of his word as he has been&#160;her&#160;carer for the past 56 years. This gentleman completes household chores, cooks, ensures Zhou takes her medicine (tasting it each time to make sure it&#8217;s not lethal), feeds her food, and changes her bed pan without any assistance. </p>
<p>All for what? For love.</p>

<p>Their&#160;deeply moving tale of adoration and friendship&#160;has been popping up all over the internet, touching readers throughout the globe. Whenever he hears of a story about a new herbal medicine he rushes into the mountains in the hopes that one day he will find a cure. Yuanfa will never give up on the woman he loves.</p>
<p>The&#160;interminable love that he shares for his wife has not gone unnoticed in his village; many bring the couple groceries and other necessities to their door. While charities&#160;help in any way they can.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Zhou may not be able to walk or move her body but in some ways she is one of the luckiest women in the world. Why? Because she has something that all human hearts seek &#8211; a love so true, so toxic, nothing can break it.&#160;</p>
<p>True love isn&#8217;t meant for the ordinary, you&#8217;ve got to be extraordinary to do something like this. Yuanfa sets an example for all of us and in my eyes is an absolute inspiration.</p>
