<p>The human body is a truly incredible and wonderful piece of equipment. Despite spending hours and hours in biology class learning about how we all work and move, there are literally so many things I&#8217;ll never come remotely close to understanding.</p>
<p>I was never a science person at school, so now my knowledge of human body extends to the injuries I&#8217;ve drunkenly inflicted on myself over the years &#8211; but I digress&#8230;</p>
<p>Here are seven incredible facts about the human body that you definitely didn&#8217;t know.</p>
