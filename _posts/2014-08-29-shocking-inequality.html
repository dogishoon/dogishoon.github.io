<p/><p>Mexico has seen a lot of economic improvement in recent years, but it still has a long way to go. Despite a growing middle class, there is still a huge segment of the population that is impoverished.</p>
<p>According to the Wilson Center, almost 46 percent of people in Mexico live in poverty. While rural residents in poverty suffer just as much, the inequality problem is especially explicit in big cities like Mexico City (as you'll see).</p>
<p>To provoke discussion on the issue, Mexican bank, Banamex (owned by Citigroup), launched a graphic public awareness campaign. It depicts the stark reality of poverty in one area of Mexico City. The bank hired photographer Oscar Ruiz to take some aerial pictures of the Santa Fé district in there. What he found is extremely disturbing. </p><p>

<p>That is disturbing. It's crazy to think that income inequality can get that bad. Don't forget to share this story on Facebook and spread the word about the dangers of poverty. </p>
