<p>It&#8217;s an unfortunate truth that there is still an element of barbarism in the human psyche&#160;which occasionally permits the most horrendous acts. However, when Jonathan Holmes decided to follow a woman home one night, he wasn&#8217;t expecting her to kick the crap out of him.</p>
<p>The incident happened in Sheffield, UK, where 35-year-old Holmes followed the woman for over a mile. According to the <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/vile-sex-attacker-left-looking-6938173?ICID=FB_mirror_main" target="_blank">Mirror</a>, he told her that she was&#160;&#8220;going to enjoy this&#8221; and stuck his tongue in her mouth. However, his victim fought back &#8211; punching him, biting his tongue and using her keys to stab him in the neck.<a href="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12.png"><br>

<p>Despite being deeply affected by the incident, the woman was brave enough to face Holmes in court.&#160;&#8220;I believed without a doubt he was going to rape me,&#8221; she explained, during the trial. Holmes, meanwhile, stated that he had been drinking and had no recollection of what happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life would have been over, he might as well have killed me right there,&#8221; the victim continued. &#8220;I was so terrified but so angry.&#8221; What happened to me was my worst nightmare. The whole thing replayed in my head for days. Now going anywhere after dark is really stressful for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one listening could fail to have been moved by her words. It is clear to me that what you did had a devastating effect on her life,&#8221; Judge Sarah Write told the court. &#8220;She is not able to continue her life as before.&#8221; Holmes may have played dumb but detectives discovered CCTV footage of him watching women throughout the afternoon.</p>
<p>I hate to imagine what the victim looked like after the ordeal. Other news reports paid little mind to how badly beaten Holmes was after the incident. I&#8217;m not sure if this is a sign that he came off better or worse.&#160;He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.</p>
