<p>Earlier this year, the world was moved and heartbroken by the photograph of the young Syrian refugee, who lay dead, face-down in the sand, after he failed to survive the treacherous journey from Syria to Greece.</p>
<p>For most people, the impact this photograph had was simply a feeling of regret and despair, which was over in a matter of days. The world keeps turning, right? There&#8217;s nothing anybody can do about it?</p>
<p>Well, we can try.</p>
<p>And one woman who is desperate to try and help the Syrian refugees is Californian mother, Cristal Logothetis. In an interview with Today, she said;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw that picture, I didn&#8217;t just see a little boy face-down on the sand, I saw what could have been my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>After watching endless news reports of Syrian refugees reaching Greece, Cristal noticed that many of them had one thing in common, as they mustered the strength for what could be hundreds of miles of walking ahead of them, until they reach their next destination.</p>
<p>Many mothers, fathers and caregivers (we cannot forget many of these people are now caring for orphans), all having to carry their children, in what must be an exhausting and gruelling trial of survival.</p>
<p>Through all weather conditions, this children must be carried&#8230; and carried&#8230; and carried&#8230;</p>
<p>Logothetis knew what action she had to take, and in response to what she saw, she started to collect baby carriers (or baby slings/harnesses), in order to provide these desperate parents with just a little comfort.</p>

<p>Cristal also sent out a message asking people to help her, and many were happy to do so.</p>
<p>She began receiving hordes of slings and harnesses, many with a note of encouragement attached for both Cristal and their new owners. And in addition to the slings, people also made donations to help Logothetis&#8217; cause, and she has since raised tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p class="_3ry4">After Cristal had collected enough carriers, she, along with 10 other mothers, all flew to Greece, where they would meet Syrian families arriving off boats. Her team would teach the parents how to use the sling &#8211; but not only that &#8211; but their mere presence provided immediate hope for the refugees, as they discovered that there are people who really do care about them.</p>

<p>Logothetis said<i>;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;All they&#8217;re trying to do is get to a better place and protect their family. Not only do they have a problem solved for them by receiving a carrier, but they realize that people care about them, that people want to help.</p>
<p>People out there, they really care. They do. They just need the right opportunity to get involved.If everybody does something, no matter how small or big, there will always be a positive impact on this planet.&#8221;</p>
