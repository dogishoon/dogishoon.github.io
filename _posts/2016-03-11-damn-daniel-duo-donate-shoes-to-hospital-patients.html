Remember Daniel Lara and Joshua Holz, the two teens who took the internet by storm last month when their video about vans shoes went viral?
</p>
<p>
Here is the twitter post that started the viral story back then <a href="https://twitter.com/Josholzz/status/699432086965366784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">"Damn Daniel"</a>.

Daniel and Josh are now back in the spotlight but this time they are giving back to their community in a beautiful way. They visited patients in Loma Linda University Children's Hospital in California, handed them free pairs of Vans shoes and signed autographs.

  "We thought it was important to do some charity work and give back to the local community," Daniel <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20160309/teens-behind-damn-daniel-visit-patients-at-loma-linda-university-childrens-hospital">told the Los Angeles Daily News.</a> "We're enjoying it. We're enjoying being here. This is a great experience."

<p>
  Good guys!
