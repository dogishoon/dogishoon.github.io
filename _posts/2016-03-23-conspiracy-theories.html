People who believe in conspiracy theories are often treated as idiots. We've all been tempted to shout "shut up" in the face of that annoying friend who;s obseesing about some conspiracy theory and just won't stop arguing that it is in fact true. While most conspiracy theories are plain false you will be amazed at how many ended up being true after enough time had passed.

<p>This makes me wonder how 9/11 and JFK would turn out a few years from now.</p>

<p>
Project MK-Ultra was the codename of a secret CIA project that started around 1950. It aimed at developing methods for mentally controlling individuals using psychotropic substances and bioelectrical signals. Rumors about MK-Ultra circulated for more than 20 years until 1975 when the project was revealed to the public thanks to a report by the New York Times and congressional and presidential investigations that followed.</p>

<p>
Everybody knows today that Asbestos exposure is a direct cause of serious and often fatal health issues like mesothelioma, asbestosis and lung cance. But during the 1920s and 1930s construction companies who were heavily using the material considered the health hazards of Asbestos merely a conspiracy theory against their interests. Years later the effects of Asbestos on human health were proven and most countries around the world have banned the use of the mineral.</p>

<p>Between 1932 and 1972, the U.S. government run a nontherapeutic experiment on a group of 399 black men from Macon County, Alabama. These men were infected with syphilis and were being used as Laboratory Animals: the government had no intention of curing them from syphilis, instead they were intentionally left without treatment to study the effect of syphilis on black men as opposed to white men. When the study was finally revealed to the public in 1972, news reporter Harry Reasoner referred to it as a study that "used human beings as laboratory animals in a long and inefficient study of how long it takes syphilis to kill someone."</p>

<p>
The Contras were Nicaraguan insurgents waging a guerrilla war against the Sandinista communist government backed by the Cubans. The conspiracy theory was that President Reagan facilitated the sale of US weapons to Iran to get them to help release American hostages from Iranian terrorists in Lebanon. And the proceeds from the sale were used to finance the Contras rebels in Nicaragua. Reagan denied such allegations in beginning but they were later proven true by commissions of investigators.</p>
