<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking ladies and gents: &#8216;what is this witchcraft? Surely no one can open a can without a can opener, it must be magic!&#8217; Well, last time I checked Harry Potter was nowhere in sight, but this shit just happened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you all thought that the internet couldn&#8217;t possibly bless us with one more glorious must-know hack, until this one came along. We have&#160;YouTuber Taras Kulakov, otherwise known as the&#160;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH2NahLjx-Y" target="_blank">Crazy Russian Hacker</a>, to thank for this one.</p>
<p>All you need is a slab of concrete, two bare hands, determination and an area that you don&#8217;t mind getting a little messy.</p>

<p>Mind = Blown.</p>
<p>Back when I was at university I ate enough canned food to feed an army and I went through enough can openers to stock my own shop. You&#8217;d think that I&#8217;d just go out and buy one of decent quality, but I was a student and broke so obviously that didn&#8217;t happen. If only I&#8217;d known this nifty trick in my younger years. That&#8217;s a lot of time and money I would have saved.</p>
<p>There you have it, if a zombie apocalypse breaks out tomorrow and you&#8217;re stuck in a room with only five cans of tuna and a slab of concrete, you can rest happy knowing that you&#8217;ll survive. At least for a few days anyway.</p>
