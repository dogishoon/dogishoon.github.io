<p>Otis Johnson has been in prison for 44 years. He was locked up in 1971 for the attempted murder of a police officer. He was only twenty five at the time.</p>
<p>He was finally released in August 2014 at the grand old age of sixty nine. A lot has changed since he was released; when he was last on the streets colour TV had only been around for around five years and there were certainly no mobile phones or internet. It must be a massive culture shock to be suddenly catapulted into the modern world.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/shorts/life-after-prison/index.html">an interview and video for Al Jazeera</a>, Johnson recently visited Times Square in New York City, where he was surprised and confused by the modern technology surrounding him: people &#8220;with wires in their ears&#8221; listening to music that looked like they were CIA agents, pedestrians &#8220;talking to themselves&#8221; on their iPhones, and neon video billboards illuminating storefront windows.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
 
 
<p>Johnson offers a fascinating perspective on our world today and the modern technology that many shrug off and take for granted&#160;We wish him all the best as he tries to adjust to the modern world.</p>
