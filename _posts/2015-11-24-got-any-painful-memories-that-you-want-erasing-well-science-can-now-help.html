<p>Have you ever wanted to have a particularly awful memory removed from your brain? Well unless you are Jim Carey in&#160;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, this has probably been a mere fantasy, until now.&#160;Scientists are saying that they can now removed and delete memories from your brain.</p>
<p>Recently, MIT researchers have shown for the first time ever that memories are stored in specific brain cells. By triggering a small cluster of neurons the researchers were able to force the subject to recall a specific memory.&#160;By removing these neurons, the subject would lose that memory.</p>
<p>The only drawback, the subjects of these tests were mice&#8230;</p>

<p>While we&#8217;re obviously a long way from being able to actually delete human memories, the most important discovery here is that we finally have proof that memories are physical rather than conceptual. The question is, would you make the choice to delete the painful memories if you could?</p>
