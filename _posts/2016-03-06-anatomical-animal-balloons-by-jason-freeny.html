<p>Jason Freeny from <a href="http://www.moistproduction.com"> MoistProduction </a> is a talented american artist who specializes in a rather weird form of art. He studied industrial design, and worked for MTV where he created digital illustrations and later became a toy designer.
Today he's showing us the anatomy of animal toys that so many of us were brought up playing with. Jason blows minds with the level of detail in his art and this collection of animal balloon anatomy is no exception.</p>
