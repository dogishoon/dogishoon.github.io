<p>It seems like being a beardy weirdy is finally going out of fashion. People are slowly returning to their clean-shaven ways. However people need to reconsider shaving off their facial hair, because bristles bring a whole load of unexpected health benefits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/enhanced-24294-1409424852-12.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-126662" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/enhanced-24294-1409424852-12.jpg" alt="enhanced-24294-1409424852-12"  ></a></p>
<p>Researchers swabbed the faces of 408 males and compared the bacteria that was found on those with a beard and those that were clean shaven. You would expect that a beard would be full off horrible bugs, but it would seem those with clean cheeks faired worst in this test.</p>
<p>The study said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Our study suggests that facial hair does not increase the overall risk of bacterial colonisation compared to clean-shaven control subjects.&#160;Clean-shaven control subjects exhibited higher rates of colonisation with certain bacterial species.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<p>Apparently those with clean shaven skin are three times more likely to be carrying harmful bacteria. I would have thought it would have been the other way around, but the study explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you shave, you cause microtrauma to the skin, resulting in abrasions, which could support bacterial colonisation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s also evidence that points toward beards actually being able to fight off infection.&#160;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35350886" target="_blank">BBC Two&#8217;s Trust Me, I&#8217;m a Doctor</a>&#160;have a theory that beards are able to create antibodies that destroy harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>So, if you know what&#8217;s good for you, you&#8217;ll keep your beard. Do you know why loads of non-redhead guys have ginger facial hair? <a href="http://www.viralthread.com/this-is-why-loads-of-non-redhead-guys-have-ginger-beards/">Click here</a>, we&#8217;ll tell you.</p>
