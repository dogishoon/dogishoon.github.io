<div><p>She was just one year old when she made her first painitng. Dimitra Milan grew up in a family of art: both of her parents were artists. They worked so hard on her homeschooling that she finished school 2 years earlier. This allowed her to focus on her art full time and achieve fame and recognistion when she was just 15 years old.</p>
<p >Her parents had their own art school, the Milan Art Institute where they offered art classes. Dimitra was obviously   one of the students. That's where she learned oil painting in the classical realistic way. Learning realism was hard for her in the begining but it taught her how to express herself.</p>

<p>Dimitra has a special relationship with her mother who "inspires her as an artist to have a responsibility to contribute towards positive change". She wants to be an inspiration for young artists to believe in their dreams and to work hard to achieve them. Creativity and passion for painting are what drives her the most in life. </p>
