<p>Thank you world for the proliferation of video-capturing gadgets,&#160;so you&#160;bullies out there&#160;can be recognised for what you really are. When&#160;the entire world watched and cheered as Casey Heynes&#160;body slammed his aggressor against the concrete, he became a poster boy for anti-bullying worldwide and many victims have since followed in his footsteps.</p>
<p>Not every child crawls up into a defenceless ball, crying and pleading for their antagonist to leave them alone. No, no, no, on the contrary, a few brave souls stand up and defend themselves.</p>
<p>Enter this kid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-14.54.07.png"><img class="img-responsive" class="alignnone wp-image-112236" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-03-at-14.54.07.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-03 at 14.54.07"  ></a></p>
 
 
 
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He was initially picked on for &#8220;talking so much shit all the time,&#8221; although he begs to differ. His attacker doesn&#8217;t even give him a chance to take off his rucksack before repeatedly punching him and dragging&#160;him to the ground. But the boy in red wasn&#8217;t about to get his arse whooped without&#160;putting up&#160;a fight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bully.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" class="alignnone wp-image-112238" src="http://www.viralthread.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/bully.jpg" alt="bully"  ></a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Although he&#160;tries to protect himself&#160;as much as he can, the bully gets on top (literally) and starts to give him a proper pummelling. That is until a red dressed vigilante decides to take a stand.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that there were numerous onlookers checking out the fight, no one bothered to step in. Until the boy&#8217;s saviour entered the scene and hit&#160;the bully with a double footed flying stomp in the back.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s got to hurt.</p>
