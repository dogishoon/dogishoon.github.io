<p>The main reason you should sleep on your left side is that it helps your digestive system process food while you sleep. If you sleep on your right side you are putting yourself at risk of getting heart burn and acid reflux. This is because&#160;the gastric juices and acids slowly drain into your oesophagus throughout the night.</p>

<p>It also helps to drain your&#160;lymphatic system which&#160;is&#160;a vital part of the immune system. Sleeping on your left side will allow glucose, proteins, and other important elements to drain to your lymphatic system faster. This will do great things to your heart and spleen.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve spent your life sleeping on your right, its time to change.</p>
