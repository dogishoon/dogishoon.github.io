<p>The Kurokis are a couple from japan who lived a happy life as dairy farmers on the countryside with their children. They got married in 1956 and have been living on the same dairy farm since then. Mrs. Kuroki diabetes got worst with age to the point that she got completely blind. The blindness had a devatating effect on her and she started struggling with depression. She stopped going outside of her house and refused to socialize with her family.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuroki loved his wife so much and was hurting from seeing her deteriorate day after day. He was constantly thinking of ways to make his wife feel better and get out of her seclusion. One day he realised that if his wife can't see, she can smell and that if he makes the outside smell so good, may be that will entice his wife desire to go out and enjoy the smell. He started growing flowers everywhere around his house. Sure it took him two years to turn the outside into a flower garden but it was worth it, his wife now enjoys going outside and enjoying the good smell of flowers. Not only that, his story now brings people from all around the world  to witness the power of unconditional love. </p>

<h3>Mrs. Kuroki now enjoys being outside among the flowers</h3>
