		<p>by</p><p><strong>Iceland is a pretty great country to be honest. They have waterfalls, lagoons, and the Northern Lights&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Their literacy rate is 99%, the sun never sets (at least not in summer) and they have a handy app to make sure no-one inadvertently commits incest.</p>
<p>You would think that hacker group Anonymous would approve of Iceland &#8211; &#160;what with their liberal stance on refugee quotas, and their informative penis museums &#8211; but the hactivists have declared cyber war on the tiny island nation.</p>

<p>Why? They disapprove of Iceland&#8217;s whaling policies.</p>
<p>In a video posted online, Anonymous said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whales do not have a voice. We will be a voice for them. Its time to speak out about this impending extinction of a species. Its time to let Iceland know we will not stand by and watch as they drive this animal to extinction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whaling is frowned on internationally (to say the least), but along with Norway and Japan, Iceland continues to hunt whales for their meat.</p>

<p>Just when we thought there wasn&#8217;t a single blemish on this volcano-garnished, hot-spring adorned, incest-free paradise!</p>
<p>Anonymous have called for a boycott on Icelandic products, and have already shut down at least five of their government&#8217;s websites, vowing to expose the cruel practices involved in whaling.</p>
