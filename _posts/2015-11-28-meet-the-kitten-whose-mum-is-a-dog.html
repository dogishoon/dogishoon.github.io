<p>When Rosie the kitten was picked up&#160;on the streets of LA, the three sisters&#160;who found her feared the worst. The three-week-old puss was on her last legs and rejected the girls&#8217; attempts to feed her. In a last ditch effort to save the cat&#8217;s life, the sisters turned to one of their pet huskies, Lilo, for help.</p>
<p>There was every chance that the husky would kill the kitten, given their natural predatory instincts, but, happily, Lilo had other ideas. She&#8217;d been unable to have pups of her own and took Rosie in as if she was her own child, allowing her to suckle and protecting her.</p>
<p>Here they are together and it&#8217;s unbelievably adorable&#8230;</p>
